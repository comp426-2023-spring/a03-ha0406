All "root authored and root committed" commits were made by me, ha0406.
All commits authored by ha0406 were also made by me.

I have found that Github was very inconsistent in establishing me as an author on my commits.
This could be due to a lot of reasons but all of the commits made by either ha0406 or "root authored and root committed" are still mine.

All of these commits in this repo were also made by me (alongside the commits that Github gave me direct credit for):
